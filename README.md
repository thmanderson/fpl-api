### Fantasy Premier League API

----
#### Overview

The goal for this repo is to come up with something that I can use to help me choose my FPL team,
taking data from the official premier league Fantasy Football site. I'm also using it as an excuse 
to practice some programming, so there may be sections which aren't quite as good as they could be, 
but I wanted to try out something specific, so just did it anyway.

#### History

##### Current Version - v0 - In Progress

Currently just working on actually how to grab all the relevant data, and how to organise it in a
useful way. Planning to 'release' this when all the underlying data is there and usable in a nice
way, I'm happy with the structure of the projects, and it's all got proper testing in place.
